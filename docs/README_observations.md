Taipy slow to install? 55 packages (check) - one particularly slow?  pyarrow?

Slow on first run (compared to Streamlit)? Actually cmd line tool doesn't exist?

Maybe not 3.13 compatible - only 3.12 I think

Streamlit feels much more solid and better tested / error-handling

Generally feels slower / less responsive
